# SDL2 mandelbrot
just a little hobby project in which I want to try to generate a mandelbrot set efficiently

## installation
- requires an installation of SDL2 on your include path, or provide your own and link in Makefile
- run ´´´make build´´´ to build the project, ´´´make test´´´ to build and instantly test

### status
- draws B&W mandelbrot set to a display of arbitrary size, adding one iteration per frame

#### planned
- colour the non-converging regions based on how many iterations it takes to escape bounds
- try to make the shapes and colours continuous. unsure if shapes require extra work but colours most likely will
- navigation controls
- performance optimisation
- smooth user experience
