# SDL2 mandelbrot
just a little hobby project in which I want to try to generate a mandelbrot set efficiently

## installation
- requires an installation of SDL2 on your include path, or provide your own
- run ´´´make build´´´ to build the project, ´´´make test´´´ to build and instantly test

### status
there is no functioning code

#### planned
- make a program that renders a black and white mandelbrot set to some kind of buffer
- colour the non-black regions based on how many iterations it takes to escape bounds
- try to make the shapes and colour continuous. unsure if shapes require extra work but colours most likely will
