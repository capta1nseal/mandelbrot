# SDL2 mandelbrot
just a little hobby project in which I want to try to generate a mandelbrot set efficiently

## installation
- requires an installation of SDL2 on your include path, or provide your own and link in Makefile
- run ´´´make build´´´ to build the project, ´´´make test´´´ to build and instantly test

### status
- draws greyscale mandelbrot set to a display of arbitrary size
- iteration count is incremented per frame

#### planned
- make the shapes and colours more continuous
- navigation controls
- performance optimisation
- (related) multithreading
- smooth user experience
